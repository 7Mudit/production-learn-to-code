# Cookie Day

## Introduction

A very caring mother has *`N`* cookie jars with her. Each jar contains a different type of cookie.

There are *A[i]* cookies in the *i*-th jar.

The mother wanted to give some cookies to her *`K`* children, and she decided to only distribute cookies **of a single type**. That is, she'll choose **exactly one** of the *`N`* jars and distribute the cookies within it.

She'd like to ensure a couple of things:

- Each child should receive **at least** 1 cookie.
- Each child should also receive an **equal number** of cookies, in the spirit of fairness.

Under the above two conditions, what is the **minimum** number of "wasted" cookies, i.e, cookies that remain in the chosen jar after distribution?

If it is not possible to give out any cookies at all, print −1 instead.

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains a single integer *`T`*, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input.
  - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers *N* and *K* — the number of cookie jars and the number of children.
  - The second line contains *N* space-separated integers *A[1]*,_A[2]_,…,*A[N]* — where *A[i]* is the number of cookies in the *i* th jar.

## Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line a single integer denoting the minimum number of cookies that will go to waste.

If it is not possible to distribute the cookies at all, output −1 instead.

## Constraints

```c++
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ A[i] , K ≤ 10^9
```

## Sample Input and Output

```c++
Input :
4
4 3
7 8 2 1
4 4
1 2 3 1
4 1
1 1 1 1
4 1000
999 1500 2024 2100

Output :
1
-1
0
24
```

## Intuition

- _Sufficient Cookies:_ We must ensure each jar has at least as many cookies as there are children (cookies >= k). If not, it's impossible to give at least one cookie to each child from that jar.
- _Minimising Waste:_ The waste in each jar is the remainder when the total cookies are divided by the number of children (cookies % k). Our goal is to find the jar where this value is minimised.
- _Feasibility Check:_ If no jar can fulfil the requirement of giving at least one cookie to each child, we output -1.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        cin >> n >> k; // Read the number of jars (n) and children (k)

        vector<int> jars(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> jars[i]; // Read the number of cookies in each jar
        }

        int minWaste = INT_MAX; // Initialize minWaste to the maximum possible value
        bool canDistribute = false; // Flag to check if distribution is possible

        for (int cookies : jars) {
            if (cookies >= k) { // Check if the jar has enough cookies
                canDistribute = true;
                int waste = cookies % k; // Calculate waste for this jar
                minWaste = min(minWaste, waste); // Update minWaste if this jar has less waste
            }
        }

        if (canDistribute) {
            cout << minWaste << endl; // Print the minimum waste
        } else {
            cout << -1 << endl; // Print -1 if distribution is not possible
        }
    }
}

```

## Time Complexity

- The outer while loop runs t times for t test cases.
- Inside each test case, we have a for loop that iterates `n` times.
- All other operations inside the for loop are constant time operations.
- Hence, the overall **time complexity** is `O(t * n)`.

## Space Complexity Analysis:

- The space complexity is primarily due to the storage of n cookies in the jars vector for each test case.
- Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.
