# Judged

## Introduction

The tech fest of IIT Ropar, *Advitiya*, has a talent show as part of the festivities.

The preliminary round of the talent show has participants being evaluated by 5 judges, and only those participants whose performance was liked by **at least 44** judges will qualify for the next round.

Anuj participated in the talent show, and now wants to know if he'll qualify or not.

You are given the responses of all 5 judges — help Anuj decide whether he qualified!

Each judge's response is given to you as a binary integer, where:

- `0` means the judge didn't like Anuj's performance.
- `1` means the judge liked Anuj's performance.

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains a single integer *`T`*, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing 5 space-separated integers R1 , _R2_ , *R*3, , *R*4 , *R*5 — the responses of the judges.

## Output Format

- For each test case, output a single line containing the string `"YES"` (without quotes) if Anuj qualifies for the next round, and `"NO"` (without quotes) if he doesn't qualify.
- Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings `NO`, `no`, `No`, and `nO` will all be treated as equivalent.

## Constraints

```cpp
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 , R5 ≤ 1
```

## Sample Input and Output

```txt
Input :
3
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1

Output :
NO
NO
YES
```

## Intuition

The problem is straightforward. We have 5 judges, each giving a binary response (1 for like, 0 for dislike) for Anuj's performance. Anuj qualifies if at least 4 judges liked his performance.

## Approach

- **Read the number of test cases (T) :** We first read the total number of test cases.
- **Process each test case :** For each test case:
  - Read the responses from the 5 judges into an array.
  - Count the number of likes (1's) in the array.
  - If the count of likes is 4 or more, Anuj qualifies (print "YES"), otherwise, he doesn't (print "NO").

## Code Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t; // Reading the number of test cases

    while (t--) {
        int arr[5]; // Array to store judges' responses
        int count = 0; // Count of likes

        // Read judges' responses
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            cin >> arr[i];
            if (arr[i] == 1) {
                count++; // Increment count if judge liked the performance
            }
        }

        // Check if Anuj qualifies
        if (count >= 4) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Reading test cases:** O(1) per test case.
- **Processing each test case:** O(5) which is O(1) since we are only processing 5 judges' responses per test case.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(T), where T is the number of test cases, as the time for processing each test case is constant.

## Space Complexity

Space for judges' responses: O(5) which is

- O(1) (constant space for storing 5 responses).
- **Other variables:** O(1) (constant additional space for variables like count, t, etc.)
- **Overall Space Complexity:** O(1), as the space required does not scale with the input size.
