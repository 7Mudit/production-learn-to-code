# Xorry 1

## Introduction

You are given an integer *`X`*. Two integers `(A , B)` are said to be an Xorry pair, if the following conditions are satisfied:

- A ⊕ B = X
- 0 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ X
- Among all the pairs which satisfy the above two conditions, `(B − A)` is as small as possible

For example, suppose `X = 6`.

Then, the pair `(0,6)` satisfies the first two conditions. But, the pair `(2,4)` also satisfies the first two conditions. And since, `(6 − 0)` is larger than `(4 − 2)`, the pair `(0,6)` does not have the smallest possible difference, and so, it is not an Xorry pair.

You can verify that the pairs `(2,4)` and `(3,5)`  are the only two Xorry pairs for `X = 6`. This is explained further in the sample explanation below.

Output any one Xorry pair for a given X.

Note that ⊕ refers to [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

## Input Format

- The first line of input will contain a single integer *`T`*, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line which contains a single integer, *`X`*.

## Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, two space separated integers, *`A`* and *`B`*, where `(*A*,*B*)` is an Xorry pair, for that particular *`X`*.

If there are multiple Xorry pairs, output any one of them.

## Constraints

```cpp
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9
```

## Intuition

The intuition behind finding an Xorry pair for a given integer X revolves around understanding how the XOR operation works and how we can leverage it to find two numbers A and B such that `A ⊕ B = X` while ensuring that the difference between A and B is as small as possible.

**XOR Property:** The XOR operation has a unique property where if you XOR two numbers and then XOR the result with one of those numbers, you get the other number. This property is fundamental in ensuring that`A ⊕ B = X` can be solved for either A or B when one of them is known.

**Choosing the Most Significant Bit (MSB) for A:** The choice of setting A to the MSB of X is based on the goal of minimizing `B − A`. The MSB represents the highest power of 2 less than or equal to X. By setting A to this value, we ensure that A is as close as possible to X while still being less than or equal to X. This choice maximizes A while minimizing the difference between A and B.

**Minimizing the Difference:** Since A is chosen to be a power of 2, and specifically the highest power of 2 within X, the difference `B − A` becomes the smallest possible. It leverages the fact that in binary, flipping the MSB changes the number significantly, leading to a close but lower value than X.

## Approach

The approach in the code follows these steps to find the Xorry pair:

- **Finding the MSB in X:** The code uses a while loop to find the position of the MSB in X. It does this by left-shifting 1 until it exceeds X. The final bit position where it exceeds gives the position of the MSB.
- **Setting A to the MSB:** Once the MSB position is found, A is set to 2 raised to the power of one less than the bit position. This is because the bit positions are zero-indexed. A now holds the value of the MSB of X.
- **Calculating B:** B is calculated by XORing A with X. Given the XOR property, this guarantees that `A ⊕ B = X.`
- **Returning the Pair:** The pair `(B,A)` is returned. However, it's crucial to note that depending on how A and B are calculated, one might need to ensure that `A ≤ B` to strictly adhere to the definition of a Xorry pair. The current implementation assumes A will always be less than or equal to B, which holds in most cases due to the choice of A being the MSB.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> findXorryPair(int X) {
    int A = 0, B = 0;
    int bitPosition = 0;

    // Find the position of the most significant bit in X
    while ((1 << bitPosition) <= X) {
        bitPosition++;
    }

    // Set A to the value of the most significant bit
    int MSB = 1 << (bitPosition - 1);
    A = MSB;
    B = A ^ X;

    return {B, A};
}

int main() {
    int T, X;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        cin >> X;
        pair<int, int> xorryPair = findXorryPair(X);
        cout << xorryPair.first << " " << xorryPair.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the MSB:** The loop runs until `1 << bitPosition` exceeds X. In the worst case, it runs as many times as the number of bits in X. Therefore, the time complexity for finding the MSB is `O(logX)`.
- **Setting A and B:** This is done in constant time.
- Overall, the time complexity of the findXorryPair function is`O(logX)`.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is determined by the amount of memory used by the variables A, B, bitPosition, and MSB.
- Since these variables use a fixed amount of space and do not depend on the size of the input, the space complexity is `O(1)` (constant space complexity).
