### Open Handset Alliance (OHA)

- A consortium of 84 firms, including HTC, Sony, Dell, Intel, and Google, formed to develop open standards for mobile devices.
- Established on November 5, 2007, with the aim to create a rich mobile ecosystem.

### Android Architecture

- **Linux Kernel**: Foundation of the Android platform, providing hardware abstraction and essential drivers.
- **Libraries**: Set of libraries including WebKit, libc, SQLite, and media libraries for audio and video playback.
- **Android Runtime**: The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) is a critical component of Android Runtime, designed and optimized for Android, particularly efficient for devices with limited memory and processor power.
- Android Runtime also includes a set of core libraries that allows Android application developers to write Android applications using standard Java programming language.

**Application Framework**:

- **Activity Manager**: Manages the app lifecycle and the stack of activities.
- **Content Providers**: Facilitate the sharing and management of data across different applications.
- **Resource Manager**: Provides access to non-code resources like strings and UI layouts.
- **Notifications Manager**: Manages the display of notifications to the user.
- **View System**: Fundamental UI components such as buttons and lists are part of this system.

**System Apps**:

- These are applications that come pre-installed with the phone and are not inherently different from regular apps in terms of capabilities. They include critical services such as the dialer or home screen.

Key libraries and components within the Android system include:

- **android.app**− Provides access to the application model and is the cornerstone of all Android applications.
- **android.content**− Facilitates content access, publishing and messaging between applications and application components.
- **android.database**− Used to access data published by content providers and includes SQLite database management classes.
- **android.opengl**− A Java interface to the OpenGL ES 3D graphics rendering API.
- **android.os**− Provides applications with access to standard operating system services including messages, system services and inter-process communication.
- **android.text**− Used to render and manipulate text on a device display.
- **android.view**− The fundamental building blocks of application user interfaces.
- **android.widget**− A rich collection of pre-built user interface components such as buttons, labels, list views, layout managers, radio buttons etc.
- **android.webkit**− A set of classes intended to allow web-browsing capabilities to be built into applications.

The Android architecture is designed to facilitate a seamless interaction between the user-facing application layer and the lower-level hardware through a well-defined stack of components. Each layer of the stack serves a specific function and provides the necessary services and APIs for the layer above it.

The Android OS architecture ensures that apps have a consistent framework to rely on for UI design, data management, network access, and more, while also allowing for a high degree of flexibility and customization. This architecture has been key to Android's wide adoption and the vast ecosystem of applications available on the platform.

### Tools Required for Android Development

- **Java JDK5 or JDK6**: The Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential for Android app development. It's a software development environment used for developing Java applications.
- **Android SDK**: The Software Development Kit (SDK) for Android includes libraries, debugger, and sample codes necessary for building Android applications.
- **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (Optional)**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, debugging, and compiling code in Java.
- **Android Development Tools (ADT) Eclipse Plugin (Optional)**: Plugin for Eclipse that extends the IDE with the ability to build Android applications.

### Steps for Setting Up the Development Environment

**Step 1: Setup Java Development Kit (JDK)**

- Download and install the JDK from Oracle's website.
- Set `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables to point to the folder where `java` and `javac` are located.
  - **Windows Users**: Add JDK paths to the `C:\\autoexec.bat` file or through the System Properties.

**Step 2: Configure Android SDK**

- After installing the SDK, launch the SDK Manager and select the required packages to install.
- Deselect 'Documentation for Android SDK' and 'Samples for SDK' to save space and reduce installation time if desired.
- Installation time depends on the internet connection speed.

**Step 3: Setup Eclipse IDE**

- Install the latest version of Eclipse.
- Launch Eclipse after installation; it should display a startup window.

**Step 4: Setup Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin**

- In Eclipse, go to `Help` > `Software Updates` > `Install New Software`.
- Add the ADT Plugin repository URL (`https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/`).
- Follow the prompts to install the ADT Plugin.

**Step 5: Create Android Virtual Device (AVD)**

- In Eclipse, open the Android AVD Manager from `Window` > `AVD Manager`.
- Click on 'New' to create a new AVD.
- Configure the AVD with the desired specifications for testing your applications.
