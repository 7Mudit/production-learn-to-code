- **Multiplexing Multiple Guests:** A guest operating system (OS) in a virtualized environment expects to have full control over the hardware. However, the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) needs to efficiently share the hardware among multiple VMs without compromising performance or security.
- **Understanding Operating Systems:** To effectively create a virtual environment, one must have a deep understanding of how operating systems work because this knowledge is crucial for manipulating the OS to run in a virtualized environment.
- **Tricking the Guest OS:** Virtualization involves tricking the guest OS into believing it has complete control over the hardware when, in fact, it is operating within a controlled environment managed by the VMM.
- **Live Migration and Containers**
  - Live migration allows for the movement of VMs between servers without downtime.
  - Containers package applications and their dependencies into a single object, which can be moved and run across various computing environments.

### Ways to Design Virtual Machine Monitors

- **Hardware Assisted Virtualization:** Modern CPUs offer features that support virtualization directly in hardware, which VMMs can leverage for better performance and security (e.g., KVM/QEMU).
- **Full Virtualization:** This is the traditional approach to virtualization, allowing an unmodified OS to run on top of the VMM as if it were the only OS on the machine (e.g., VMware).
- **Paravirtualization:** This method involves modifying the OS's source code to interact more efficiently with the virtualization layer, allowing for increased performance (e.g., Xen).

### Virtualization of System Components

**CPU, Memory, I/O Devices Virtualization:** Each of these hardware components must be effectively virtualized to ensure that the VMs operate efficiently and securely. This includes allocating resources, managing queues, and handling interrupts in a way that is transparent to the guest OS.
