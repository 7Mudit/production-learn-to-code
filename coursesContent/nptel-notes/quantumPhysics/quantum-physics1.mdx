## Limitations of Classical ideas - need for Quantum theory

Experimental data in the Microscopic world (inside an atom or nucleus) - classical laws are inadequate

1. **Black Body Spectrum -** Imagine an object that absorbs all the light that hits it (no light bounces off or passes through it). This kind of ideal object is called a "black body" in physics. Now, when this black body is heated, it doesn't just get hot; it starts to glow and emit its own light. The interesting part is the color of this light changes as the temperature changes. At lower temperatures, the light might be red, and as the temperature increases, it might shift to white or even blue. The "black body spectrum" refers to this range of colors (or more technically, wavelengths) of light that the black body emits at different temperatures. It's like how a metal rod glows red when heated and then turns white-hot at higher temperatures.
2. **Photo electric effect -** This is a phenomenon where light hitting a metal surface can knock electrons off the surface. Think of it like a game of pool where the light particles (called photons) are like the cue ball. When these photons hit the electrons (which are like the balls on the pool table), they can knock these electrons out of the metal, just like a cue ball would hit and move the pool balls. However, there's a catch: not just any light can do this. The light needs to have enough energy (or be of a specific color) to knock the electrons loose. This effect was crucial in the early days of quantum mechanics because it showed that light behaves like both a wave and a particle, challenging previous ideas about light and leading to the development of modern quantum theory.
3. **Compton Scattering -** Compton Scattering is another important concept in quantum mechanics, and I'll explain it in simple terms:

   Imagine you're playing tennis and you hit a tennis ball (which is light in this analogy) towards a much heavier bowling ball (which represents an electron). When the tennis ball hits the bowling ball, it bounces back, but with less speed and in a slightly different direction. In this interaction, some of the tennis ball's energy is transferred to the bowling ball.

   Now, let's translate this into physics terms:

   1. **The Tennis Ball (Light Photon):** In Compton Scattering, we're dealing with light, but not just any light ‚Äì we're talking about light as a stream of particles called photons. Each photon carries a certain amount of energy.
   2. **The Bowling Ball (Electron):** The photons interact with electrons, which are much smaller parts of an atom.
   3. **The Collision**: When a photon hits an electron, it's like our tennis ball hitting the bowling ball. The photon gives some of its energy to the electron. As a result, the photon loses energy.
   4. **The Outcome**: After losing energy, the photon moves away with less energy, which in the world of light means it has a longer wavelength. This change in the photon's wavelength is the core of Compton Scattering.

   In simple terms, Compton Scattering shows us how light (photons) can be scattered by electrons, and in the process, change their energy and wavelength. This phenomenon was crucial in demonstrating that light has particle-like properties, which was a key development in quantum mechanics.

These all three things can only be explained using quantum ideas not classical ideas . So one of the core important thing which went into all the 3 aspects of quantum aspects of photon, what is that? ‚Äî Is the **Universal Planck constant.**

**Planck's Law:** Describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a definite temperature.

For massless photons -

```
E = pc = hv
```

```
p = hv/c = h/Œª
```

where :

p = momentum

h = planck‚Äôs constant

Œª = wavelength

c = speed of light

de-broglie proposed that equation for the wavelength of matter waves must obey same equation of photon momentum.

## Matter waves

For an electron moving in circular orbit of radius r constructive interference of electron wave with itself in the orbit requires `2œÄr = nŒª`

**Bohr's Quantization:** Circular orbit constructive interference leads to quantization of orbital angular momentum.

Usually, when we are given an electron or when are given a photon, we see photon as an electromagnetic light. We see electron as a point particle.But in this course, you should remember that a particle and the wave are part of every object and what we try to tap is what you will get, okay. So it depends on the situation. If you are doing photoelectric effect, you will get only the particle nature of photon. If you are doing interference experiments, you will get wave nature of photon. Similarly, electrons, if you doing collision experiments in your classical physics, it is like a particle nature.But if you are doing dissection experiment, it shows the wavelength, okay. Depending on the experimental setup and its energy, things are going to be different and that is what is happening in the microscopic world. What we see in our day to day life, is the microscopic effect. But what is happening inside an atom or inside a proton, are governed by quantum ideas, okay. You cannot use your classical ideas and say that what I see here should happen in the **microscopic world**. We do see violations, that is why we started introducing the **quantum ideas**

Example - Like for example tunnelling, I cannot just go over, across this wall outside but you can still get, if it is a wave, a sound wave could cross across, right. That is once it is a wave, things can cross.That information can be there in a region where a particle cannot go out but a wave can go out, okay.

## Wave - Particle Duality

- Fundamental concept of quantum mechanics stating that every particle or quantum entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles but also of waves.
- **Young‚Äôs Double-Slit Experiment:** Demonstrated that light can display characteristics of both waves and particles.
- **De Broglie Hypothesis:** Extended wave-particle duality to matter, proposing that particles like electrons also have wave-like properties.

Why we do not see wave character ? Because it is very very small which cannot be measured in the present day. But if you take an electron whose mass is nearly small, then the wavelength is a measurable regime. But which is dominant in our case is only the particle character. But wave character needs a measurement of wavelength which is within the experimental regime.
