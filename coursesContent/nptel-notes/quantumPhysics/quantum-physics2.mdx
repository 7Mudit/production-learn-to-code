# Week 1 Lecture 2

## Wave-Function

We define the probability of finding a particle between x and x + dx at time t as follows :

If you want to find the particle between `b` and `a` we can simply integrate and you will get shaded area under the curve. Formula -

## Oscillatory functions

- Oscillatory functions are wave functions that exhibit periodic oscillations as a function of position or time.
- In quantum mechanics, oscillatory behaviour is often associated with particles in potential wells or barriers.

## Example Oscillatory Function:

An example of an oscillatory function is _e<sup>ikx </sup>_, where k is the wave number.

The probability density for an oscillatory function is constant and does not depend on x for plane waves. This is because the oscillatory nature of the wave function ensures that the probability is evenly distributed over all positions.

The lecture briefly mentions that for oscillatory functions, even though an integral may appear to be infinite, regularisation can be achieved by considering a bounded region (e.g., from −L to L) and later taking the limit L→Infinity.

## Square-Integrable Functions

Squared integrable functions are those for which `ψ(x,t)` goes to zero faster than
`1  / √|x|` as |x| tends to infinity.

Most of the time your condition may not be normalised but you can normalise it.

## Ehrenfest Theorem:

- The expectation values of position and momentum in quantum mechanics satisfy classical laws.
- The rate of change of the expectation value of position is equal to the expectation value of momentum.

## Boundary Conditions for Potentials:

- The continuity of the wave function and its first derivative across boundaries is discussed for finite potentials.
- For infinite potentials, the derivative of the wave function might not be continuous. The derivative of wave function cannot be checked for infinite potentials.

## Delta Function Potential:

A delta function potential, often denoted as V(x)=V<sub>0</sub>δ(x) is a mathematical construct used in quantum mechanics to model an infinitely narrow and tall potential barrier at a specific point in space. The delta function potential is centered at x=0, and V<sub>0</sub> represents the strength of the potential.

The delta function potential is described by the `Dirac delta function δ(x))` , which is not a conventional function but rather a distribution. It is defined such that:

/>

The delta function potential introduces a discontinuity in the potential energy at x=0, representing a sudden change in the potential energy experienced by a quantum particle at that point.

## Schrödinger Equation with Delta Function Potential:

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass m in the presence of a delta function potential V(x) = V<sub>0</sub> δ(x) is given by:

  className="shadow-xl rounded-xl"
/>

In regions where x ≠ 0, the potential energy `V(x) = 0` , and the Schrödinger equation simplifies to the standard form. However, at x=0, the delta function potential introduces a term proportional to -V<sub>0</sub>δ(x), causing a change in the behaviour of the wave function at that point.

## Behaviour of Wave function

The behaviour of the wave function `(ψ(x))` in the vicinity of the delta function potential depends on the energy of the particle:

1. **E &lt; V0:** For energy levels below the potential height ( E &lt; V<sub>0</sub>), the wave function exhibits an exponential decay as it approaches x=0. This represents a bound state.
2. **E &gt; V0:** For energy levels above the potential height ( E &gt; V<sub>0</sub>) , the wave function shows oscillatory behaviour near x=0, signifying a scattering state.
