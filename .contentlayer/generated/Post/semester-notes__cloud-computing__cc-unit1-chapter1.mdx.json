These systems are characterized by their ability to manage workloads by distributing tasks across various machines, improving performance and reliability. If one component fails, others can take over, thus providing fault tolerance and continuous service.\n\n## Fundamental Models\n\n- **Interaction Models**: Address performance issues like timing and the rate of event handling.\n- **Failure Models**: Define how systems handle different types of failures, including omission and arbitrary failures.\n- **Security Models**: Concerned with protecting systems from threats to processes and communication channels.\n\n### Interaction Model Challenges\n\n- Unpredictable timing and varying message delivery rates are common in distributed systems.\n- Processes maintain their own state with no single unified time, leading to clock drifts and coordination challenges.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- **Latency**: The delay between message transmission and receipt, affected by network traffic and processing time.\n- **Bandwidth**: The volume of data that can be transmitted over a network within a certain time frame.\n\n### Interaction Model Flavours\n\n- **Synchronous Model**: Assumes known time boundaries for execution and clock drift, uses timeouts for failure detection.\n- **Asynchronous Model**: Makes no assumptions about timing, allowing more flexible resource sharing and complex designs.\n\n### Failure Models\n\n- **Omission Failures**: Messages or actions that are dropped or missed. Process crashed and will not execute any further.\n- **Arbitrary (Byzantine) Failures**: Erratic behavior from processes or channels that are unpredictable and harder to detect. Integrity of data or processing steps are in error and undetectable by other processes.\n\n### **Omission and Arbitrary Failures**\n\nOmission and arbitrary failures refer to the various ways in which a distributed system can fail. Failures in distributed systems are typically categorized by how they affect either the processes or the communication channels.\n\n1. **Fail-stop**: This type of failure occurs when a process halts and remains halted. Other processes in the system may be able to detect this halt.\n2. **Crash**: Similar to a fail-stop, a crash means the process halts and remains halted. However, other processes might not be able to detect this state.\n3. **Omission**: This occurs when a message that is supposed to be sent or received is not. For example, a message might be lost in the network, or a process might fail to place a message into its outgoing message buffer.\n4. **Send-omission**: A process completes a send operation, but the message is not put in its outgoing message buffer, leading to a failure to send the message.\n5. **Receive-omission**: A process fails to take a message from its incoming message buffer, thus failing to receive it.\n6. **Arbitrary (Byzantine)**: This is the most severe type of failure, where a process or channel may exhibit unpredictable or incorrect behavior. This could include sending messages at arbitrary times, committing omissions, or executing incorrect operations.\n\n### **Timing Failures**\n\nTiming failures are related to the performance aspects of a distributed system, particularly concerning the adherence to time constraints.\n\n1. **Clock**: This type of failure is when a process's local clock drifts too much from real time, leading to inconsistencies in time-dependent processes.\n2. **Performance (Process)**: A failure where a process takes longer than the expected or bounded time to complete its steps.\n3. **Performance (Channel)**: When the transmission of a message takes longer than the stated bound, causing delays in communication.\n\nThese types of failures have different implications for synchronous and asynchronous systems. Synchronous systems operate with defined time limits, making certain types of timing failures more critical, as they can lead to a breakdown in the coordination between processes. Asynchronous systems, on the other hand, do not guarantee time limits, which means that timing failures may have less impact on the system's overall functioning.\n\n### **Masking Failures**\n\nMasking failures are techniques or mechanisms that make the system continue to operate in the presence of failures.\n\n1. **Checksums**: These are used to detect errors in data transmission. If a checksum does not match, the data can be retransmitted.\n2. **Message Retransmission**: If a message is known to be lost or corrupted, it can be sent again to ensure delivery.\n3. **Redundant Servers**: By having multiple servers performing the same task, the system can tolerate the failure of one or more servers without service interruption.\n4. **Validity**: Any message is eventually delivered, assuming the network and processes are operational.\n5. **Integrity**: A message received is identical to the message sent, and no messages are delivered twice.\n\n### Processes and Channels\n\n- Communication in distributed systems occurs between processes through channels, each having their own message buffers.\n- Ensuring reliable communication despite potential failures is a key aspect of system design.\n\n### **Failure Models in Distributed Systems:**\n\n1. **Access Rights and Principles:**\n   - The client-server model is foundational in distributed systems, where clients request services and servers provide them.\n   - Access rights define what operations can be performed on shared resources or objects within the system.\n   - Principles refer to the entities (users or processes) that have specific access rights.\n2. **Security Threats:**\n   - Distributed systems face security threats from adversaries who may have legitimate or unauthorized access to the network.\n   - Threats to processes make identity verification challenging, as clients or servers may not be able to confirm each other’s identity.\n   - Communication channels are vulnerable, allowing adversaries to copy, alter, or inject messages.\n   - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks occur when the system is overwhelmed with excessive requests, depleting resources.\n   - Mobile code security concerns arise from malicious software like Trojan horses and viruses.\n3. **The Enemy (Adversary):**\n   - An illustration of an adversary in the communication channel shows the potential for intercepting and modifying messages between processes.\n   - The adversary’s ability to copy and alter messages compromises the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.\n4. **Defeating Security Threats:**\n   - Encryption using cryptography, particularly secret key pairs, is essential for secure message exchanges.\n   - Authentication ensures that message senders are who they claim to be, protecting against impersonation.\n   - Secure channels, like those using SSL (Secure Socket Layer), provide a protected pathway for communication, ensuring that messages are not intercepted or tampered with.\n   - Designing with worst-case scenarios in mind helps in building robust security measures.\n5. **Secure Channels:**\n   - Secure channels between processes are depicted, emphasizing the importance of protecting communication in a distributed system.\n   - The use of secure channels prevents adversaries from gaining access to the messages being exchanged, ensuring that communication remains confidential and unaltered.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nDistributed systems are composed of independent yet interconnected computers that cooperate to perform collective tasks. These systems are characterized by their scalability, resilience to faults, and ability to manage a heterogeneous mix of resources and processes. However, distributed systems must confront various challenges, including latency in communications, maintaining data consistency, detecting and handling faults, and securing the network from various threats.\n\nArchitectural models like client-server and peer-to-peer frameworks provide structure to these systems, and communication is facilitated through mechanisms such as message passing and RPCs. Applications of distributed systems are vast and include distributed databases and file systems, which are crucial for handling large datasets over networks.\n\nConsistency models are implemented to ensure data remains consistent across the system. Replication enhances reliability, and load balancing optimizes resource utilization. Examples of distributed systems in use today include Google's backend infrastructure and Amazon Web Services.\n\nEmerging trends in the field point towards edge computing to reduce latency, the adoption of blockchain technology for secure transactions, and serverless computing models for more efficient resource usage. Distributed systems will continue to evolve, striking a balance between their inherent benefits and the complexities they introduce. Innovations in this area are pivotal to the advancement of technology and the way we interact with and leverage computational resources.\n",
